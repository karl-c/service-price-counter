# Service Price Counter

A simple program that allows you to set names and prices of services in HTML, which are then parsed by JavaScript to crease the responsive page in front of you. Originally created just to test my JS knowledge; nothing big.

Created using Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, Sass, OdometerJS and jQuery.
